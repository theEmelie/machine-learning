# To run the project 

### ´npm install´
install node modules

### ´node app.js iris/banknote´
add 'iris' or 'banknote' after node app.js to read in wanted file,
default is iris if nothing is typed in

## Test cases

You can verify your results with the results in [Web ML Experimenter](http://aiguy.000webhostapp.com/webml/experimenter.html). The *Iris* dataset is built-in in Web ML (click the *Try Iris dataset* button), and the *Banknote authentication* can be uploaded from the CSV file. Note that the cross-validation results can differ slightly due to how the data is split into folds, but the accuracy you get should be almost similar to the accuracy in Web ML.
